Pigeon view


-- Internal writes
- Interact with warp contracts (done via main wallet too on auth0 side)


-- Master wallet
- Upload file to arweave
- Interact with smartweave contracts


-- Other functions
- Query user ID to warp contract (this can be stored on EXM and queried from SDK but stored in auth0 client metadata as a backup (store API keys in actions is fine))


-- Data need to be done
- Also users txns from master wallet to warp (store in warp contracts state too (as its freeeeeee on chain) then we can query viewblock type dashboard from there) ()


bottom line is auth0 should be handling everything and all SDK would be is a way to interact with it


have paid section then 2 times a day pulls backend functions, then normal GET/POST API
then triggers a ALL_APP refresh req
then have API docs for dev reqs
